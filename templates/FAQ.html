                                        ezTruck does not take any liability for the goods being shipped unless it is

                                        reckless driving. Only in such cases, after the evidence is shared with us, as
                                        per law, the transporter's
                                        liability is restricted to the lower of: (i) value of goods damaged; and (ii)
                                        ten times the freight amount paid or payable, unless a higher risk rate has been
                                        charged and agreed to be paid by the Customer. We do
                                        not charge a risk rate and our billable rates are purely a factor of utilization

                                        extreme caution in case of transporting extremely fragile / flammable goods or
                                        goods which are prone to damage while transporting. If
