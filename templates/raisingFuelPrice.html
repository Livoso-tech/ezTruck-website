                    <h2>Is Increasing fuel price affecting Logistics Industry in India?? </h2>
                    <h3>Raising prices of petrol & diesel stressing logistics business out. </h3>
                    <p>India was slowly recovering from the destructive second weave of this deadly pandemic. It wasn’t easy for our country to recover so easily and fast. Surviving the second wave was throbbing for the common man more than anyone. The pandemic
                        was getting people infected both physically and financially. The recovery process wasn’t over when the increase in inflation led to the hike in prices of cooking oil, LPG, petrol, diesel, and other essential commodities. This eventually
                        became the main concern for all sectors. A survey proved that people are cutting down their other necessary expenses to manage their spending on fuel.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>There is many reasons behind the rise in fuel prices. But more than the reasons the effects are frightful. The rise in fuel prices affected the Logistics Industry besides the Indian household. And truck drivers could lose their businesses
                        due to the fuel price hike. Many of them are single-truck owners. As a result, their fleets could be severely affected by the increase in fuel prices. As the cost of fuel rises, many freight carriers pass along the increased costs
                        to their customers. It also affects the profitability of the company as well as the profit source of the company.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A 10% increase in fuel costs will increase the cost of shipping goods by 2% as said by economists. Fares calculated according to distance are affected by steadily rising fuel prices. Already suffering from a pandemic, the logistics
                        industry is struggling. As fuel prices go up, transportation costs inevitably go up. The E-commerce logistics industry needs to regulate itself accordingly, which has an immediate impact on the margins generated by e-commerce companies.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Fuel costs account for more than 60% of total transportation costs. As for large firms working with large-scale companies, they face difficulties because of the rise in fuel prices. Small carriers and truck owners find their business
                        unsustainable due to intensifying competition and increased fuel consumption, due to which their revenues are in a declining stage. Fleet owners are reducing the number of vehicles in their fleet and stopping buying new ones.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Commercial transportation, and road transportation, is suffering the most due to higher fuel prices. Moreover, due to poor fuel management and efficiency resulting in low mileage, transporters struggle to balance operational cost and
                        revenue. Apart from that, airways as a mode of transportation are suffering due to rising fuel costs while demand stays low. Logistics is one of the most important cost factors in e-commerce. The recent e-commerce boom has created
                        a great demand for logistics services, increasing the demand for fuels that are widely used in the industry. The logistics industry needs to quickly adjust to achieve the right margins for the upcoming holiday season. While global
                        trends have a big impact, drastic tax cuts can certainly ease the burden of reducing profits for the e-commerce industry and logistics.
